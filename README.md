## Service goal
The service goal is server a GET API, which returns a Github repo, as a file tree with hierarchy.

## How to start
- `npm i` - to install dependencies
- `npm start` - will start the service on port 3000 (you can export `PORT` to start on a different port)
- `GET http://localhost:3000/owners/{owner_name}/repos/{repo_name}/tree` - Is the endpoint. Just fill in the owner and repository names.

## Have fun!
